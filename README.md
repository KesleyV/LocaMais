It is expected that within the code folder there will already be an executable called “Loca Mais” and then just run it.

However, if it does not exist, follow the following steps:

To compile the program, run the following command line in the terminal:

gcc -o locacamais main.c client.c vehicle.c locacao.c menu.c decorador.c -o “Loca Mais”

Then look for the executable called “Loca Mais” in the code folder and run it or run the following command ./Loca Mais

Use the keyboard directional keys to navigate the menu
